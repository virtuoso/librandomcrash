This is a brief description of how LRC overrides library calls.

First, there's a list of the calls to be intercepted, in the file called
symbols.list. A call is described by its name, arguments and return type:

---cut---
ssize_t read
	int fd
	void * buf
	size_t count
---cut---

pretty much self-evident. Make sure there's always at least a whitespace
between type and name: for example, "void *buf" will not work, make it
"void * buf" instead.
A new call definition starts at the beginning of the line, its arguments
follow immediately, each starting with a tab on a new line.
In that file you should also specify necessary header files so that all
the type names make sense: "-- include <sys/types.h>".

Then, a script called symbols.awk will parse symbols.list and output two
files: symols.h and symbols.c.
symbols.h will define structures that contain arguments for each call
plus a void pointer for LRC's purposes:

---cut---
struct __lrc_callctx_read {
        void *priv;
        int     fd;
        void *  buf;
        size_t  count;
};
---cut---

symbols.c will have the actual calls, each doing the following:
  * create an instance of a corresponding structure from symbols.h and
    fill it with its arguments;
  * call __lrc_call_entry() to notify LRC that a certain call is made
    from the application;
  * if the above returns zero, call the original library function;
  * call __lrc_call_exit() to notify LRC that we are about to return
    execution flow to the application;
  * return.

This allows LRC to:
  * find a suitable handler for a particular call;
  * decide if the original function should be called at all;
  * modify the arguments that are passed to it if need be;
  * modify the arguments and the return value.
